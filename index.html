      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I work in planning and permitting! Anyhow, I am much more than my work. Ask away.g with many </p>
       <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
       <p>I am from Central California! Out in the sticks they call it. A smaaaaalll place called Visali. Or Tulare. Or if you know Fresno, just know I'm somewhere within an hour vicinity, that close enough.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to do many things. Some might call me a jack of all trades. But then again that might be a lie too, I think I am perfectly mediocre at all. Thats a skill right? I am definitely passionate about the guitar, drawing, traveling, exploring new foods, people, languages, thoughts, ways of life, philosophies.... books, movies.. this list is really dragging on and probably going to crash my first html page. Ill give it a rest, its pretty late.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Bothell. If you want any more information that sounds a bit invasive, ya better buy me dinner first.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I like the idea of working on projects that give you the opportunity to have to dig a little deeper. I think my current career in planning makes you think. I am basically a glorified fact finder and problem solver. I think this could easily describe software developers job as well, just through a different application. I see a path to growth that excites me, and quite frankly, it was an itch I just had to scratch. </p>
